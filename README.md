# Video-Based Detection of Combat Positions and Automatic Scoring in Jiu-jitsu

This repository implements a system for detecting combat positions and automatically scoring Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) matches using video-based analysis. The project is inspired by the paper *"Video-Based Detection of Combat Positions and Automatic Scoring in Jiu-jitsu"* and leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to:  

- Identify key combat positions (e.g., guard, mount, side control).  
- Automate the scoring process based on official BJJ scoring rules.  
- Provide an accurate, scalable, and efficient tool for match analysis and refereeing assistance.  

This repository includes model training, evaluation, and inference scripts, along with pre-processing pipelines for video data.
